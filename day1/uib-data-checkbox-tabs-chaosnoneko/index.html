      <h1>Three Popular Open Game Chess Openings</h1>
      <p>
        White starts by playing 1.e4 (moving his king pawn two spaces). This is
        the most popular opening move and it has many strengths—it immediately
        works on controlling the center, and it frees two pieces (the queen and
        a bishop). The oldest openings in chess follow 1.e4. Bobby Fischer rated
        1.e4 as "Best by test." On the downside, 1.e4 places a pawn on an
        undefended square and weakens d4 and f4. If Black mirrors White's move
        and replies with 1...e5, the result is an open game.

        Here, we will look at three of the most popular chess openings that lead
        to an open game.

          <span>Ruy Lopez</span>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Ruy Lopez (/rɔɪ, ˈruːi/; Spanish: [ˈruj ˈlopeθ]),also called
              the Spanish Opening or Spanish Game, is a chess opening
              characterised by the moves:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>e4 e5</li>
              <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
              <li>Bb5</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The Ruy Lopez is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López
              de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with such a
              vast number of variations that all codes from C60 to C99 in the
              Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) are assigned to them.

          <span>Giuoco Piano</span>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Giuoco Piano (Italian: "Quiet Game"; pronounced [dʒwɔːko
              ˈpjaːno]), also called the Italian Game, is a chess opening
              beginning with the moves:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>e4 e5</li>
              <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
              <li>Bc4 Bc5</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              "White aims to develop quickly – but so does Black. White can
              construct a pawn centre but in unfavourable conditions a centre
              which cannot provide a basis for further active play." (Marović
              &amp; Sušić 1975:53)
            </p>
            <p>
              The name Italian Game is used by some authors(Pinski 2005:5);
              however that name is also used to describe all openings starting
              1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, including 3...Nf6 (the Two Knights
              Defence) and other less common replies.

          <span>The Scotch Game</span>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Scotch Game, or Scotch Opening, is a chess opening that begins
              with the moves:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>e4 e5</li>
              <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
              <li>d4</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Ercole del Rio, in his 1750 treatise Sopra il giuoco degli
              Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche d’anonimo Autore Modenese ("On the
              game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese
              Author"), was the first author to mention what is now called the
              Scotch Game. The opening received its name from a correspondence
              match in 1824 between Edinburgh and London. Popular in the 19th
              century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favour among top players
              because it was thought to release the central tension too early
              and allow Black to equalise without difficulty. More recently,
              grandmasters Garry Kasparov and Jan Timman helped to re-popularize
              the Scotch when they used it as a surprise weapon to avoid the
              well-analysed Ruy Lopez.
